This repo contains all the work that I've done and study that I plan to do, to get into the field of BioInformatics.

## Books 

## DataScience

## Biology
- Rosalind BioInformatics problems
- An Introduction to BioInformatics Algorithms, Pevzner
- BioInformatics and Functional Genomics, Pevsner

## Programming Languages
- Python
- Julia
- R
- Scala
- Ruby
- Powershell

** I'll have to stick to the languages which are used by the majority of BioInformatics community here.

** I'll rely on SageMath and Mathematica for various understanding and exploring various mathematical ideas and concepts.

Of the various courses, I've completed in these online platforms, I'd much rather do them again, with `Julia`, `Racket` and `Scala` in mind, deep inside ths feels right and makes me inspired to really `understand the essence` of these courses.

## Coding Platforms
- Rosalind

```
 Courage is one part brave, three part fool - Brom, Eragon
```


 I, of course, shall peek solutions to various ways of doing things after an honest attempts. I realize that this project will take a lot of time so I'm in for the long run ;P
